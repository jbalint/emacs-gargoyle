* Lisp Representation of Java Objects

  In C code, a Java object is represented by a pointer. When objects
  are returned from C code, they are wrapped as Lisp structures by
  calling =gg--new-object=. When we say "Java object", we are
  generally referring to a Lisp-wrapped version of the object. When we
  say *raw object*, we are referring to the List representation of the
  pointer.

  Functions ending with =-raw= accept /raw objects/ as arguments. All
  others accept Java objects.
