Gargoyle Tests

* Running
  Tests are run with =ert-runner= and can be run with the =check=
  target in the =Makefile=.

* VM vs NoVM tests
  Some tests require being able to control the VM. Given that the VM
  can only be started once per process, these tests must run in their
  own Emacs process. This separation is implemented by putting all the
  NoVM tests in the =no-vm= subdirectory. These tests will NOT have
  the Gargoyle VM started for them automatically as all other tests
  will.
